#### Setup:

Create a new AppyBuilder project and name it TestAdmob

Once Design Editor opens, from the left Category Palette, select the Monetize category, then drag the AdMob \(visible component\) and drop into the Layout. You are now able to select this Component \(2\), and change the Ad-Unit-ID property \(3\) in the Properties Palette. _**NOTE: For testing, you should use TEST AdUnitId. See link **_[_**HERE **_](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/test-ads)_**for these IDs. **_![](/assets/bookAdMob1.png)
