This is a visible component that displays a **list **of Images and Text elements in a **ListView **like below:

The list can be set using the **ElementsFromString **property or using the **Elements **block in the blocks editor. 

In this example, we will build an app that will show fish images and text description in a ListView. Clicking an item will display a large image of the selected row. It will also display a textual description of the selected image. The source for this sample app can be found here in the forum community here: [http://community.appybuilder.com/t/custom-listview/1402/29](http://community.appybuilder.com/t/custom-listview/1402/29)
